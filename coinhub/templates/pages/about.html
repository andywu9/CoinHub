        <div class="w3-container">
         <p>Coinhub came to be as a project for Rensselaer Community of Open Source class at RPI. We decided to do a project around cryptocurrency since it was a hot
             topic at the start of the semester. Our initial idea involved around making a website where users could log in, have access to their crypto, and
             trade with the many different exchanges. This idea became a little above our heads when we were disccussing the privacy and issues of holding users
             many different coins and money. We decided to continue forward with this idea, and handle the legal issues when we had more of the website fully build. This is where we stand currently.

            <div class="w3-container">
               <p> We decided to create this project with the hopes that it would benefit investors of the cryptocurrency space
                  We believe that the website should be open source to support the growing community of crytocurrency users. Open source software thrives in a tight community, and so it only makes sense for this project to be open source.
